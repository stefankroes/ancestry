# Ancestry Changelog

The latest version of ancestry is recommended. The three numbers of each version
numbers are respectively the major, minor and patch versions. We started with
major version 1 because it looks so much better and ancestry was already quite
mature and complete when it was published. The major version is only bumped when
backwards compatibility is broken. The minor version is bumped when new features
are added. The patch version is bumped when bugs are fixed.
